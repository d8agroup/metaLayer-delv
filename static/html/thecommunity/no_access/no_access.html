                We’re slowly rolling out access to metaLayer.com
                to the general public. Right now it’s only available to our private beta
                participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the next few days you’ll receive an email inviting you to use the
                credentials you just entered to join. Then you can begin visualizing and
                mashing-up data at will.
            </p>
            <h2>Thanks and we look forward to your feedback soon!</h2>
